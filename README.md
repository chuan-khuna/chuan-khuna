## Hi, My name is Phattharanat 👋

#### ⌛/Now

- 🔥burnout because of I think there is no reward and feedback for my learning progress.
- learning about characteristics of English accents especially UK accents such as modern RP, Posh and Cockney.  

#### 🍵/About Me 

I am ~~looking for~~(now: 🔥burnout ) a position in the data science field.

I implemented some simple machine learning models in Data Mining course.

I am learning more about machine learning and deep learning.

I am healed a little bit, still have burnout, but I think I have a plan - I wish to work in UK.
